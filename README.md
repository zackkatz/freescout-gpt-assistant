## üéØ Usage

### Generating Responses

1. **Open a FreeScout conversation**
2. **Optional: Add context** - Type any context or notes in the reply field (e.g., "this was a bug and we fixed it for today's 3.43.3 update")
3. **Press your configured shortcut** (default: Ctrl+Shift+G)
4. **Wait for generation** - you'll see "ü§ñ Generating AI response..."
5. **Review and edit** the generated response as needed
6. **Send the response** using FreeScout's normal send button

### Using Optional Context

You can provide additional context to help the AI generate more accurate responses:

**Example workflow:**
- **Type in reply field**: "this was a bug and we fixed it for today's 3.43.3 update"
- **Press Ctrl+Shift+G**
- **AI generates**: "Hi John, thanks for reporting this issue. This was indeed a bug that we've addressed in today's 3.43.3 update. Please update to the latest version and the issue should be resolved. Let me know if you need any help with the update process. Best, Sarah"

**Common context examples:**
- "offer 20% discount for renewal"
- "this feature will be available in next month's release"
- "customer is on legacy plan, needs migration"
- "escalate to development team"

### Providing Feedback on AI Responses

After each AI response is generated, you'll see feedback buttons:

**Rate the response:**
- **üëç Good** - Response was helpful and accurate
- **üëé Needs Work** - Response needs improvement

**For negative feedback:**
- Provide specific notes about what could be improved
- Common feedback areas: tone, accuracy, length, context usage

**Feedback Analytics:**
- View success rates and improvement trends in extension settings
- Get personalized suggestions based on your feedback patterns
- Export detailed feedback reports for analysis

## üìä Response Feedback System

The extension includes an intelligent feedback system to help you track and improve AI response quality over time.

### How It Works

**After each AI response generation:**
1. **Feedback buttons appear** below the reply editor (üëç Good / üëé Needs Work)
2. **Rate the response** with a single click
3. **Add improvement notes** (optional) for negative feedback
4. **Data is stored locally** in your browser for privacy

### Feedback Analytics Dashboard

**Available in extension settings:**
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of positive vs negative responses (last 30 days)
- **Response Volume**: Total number of rated responses
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI-powered recommendations based on feedback patterns
- **Trend Analysis**: Track improvement over time

### Common Feedback Patterns

The system automatically identifies issues and provides suggestions:

| **Issue Detected** | **Suggested Improvement** |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Too formal/robotic | Add "Use a friendly, conversational tone" to system prompt |
| Too casual | Add "Maintain a professional tone" to system prompt |
| Missing context | Provide more specific context before generation |
| Too long/verbose | Reduce max tokens or add "Be concise" to system prompt |
| Too short/incomplete | Increase max tokens or add "Provide detailed explanations" |
| Wrong tone | Review tone instructions and previous message analysis |

### Data Management

**Granular cleanup options in settings:**
- **Clear 30+ days old** - Remove outdated feedback entries
- **Clear 90+ days old** - More aggressive cleanup for storage management
- **Clear negative only** - Focus on positive patterns only
- **Clear all feedback** - Complete reset of feedback data

**Export and Analysis:**
- **View All Feedback Data** - Opens comprehensive HTML report
- **Individual entry details** - Response text, notes, customer context, timestamps
- **Bulk statistics** - Success rates, common issues, improvement trends

### Privacy and Storage

- **Local storage only** - All feedback data stays in your browser
- **No external servers** - Complete privacy and control
- **Automatic cleanup** - Configurable retention periods
- **Export capability** - Take your data with you anytime

### Best Practices

**For optimal feedback insights:**

1. **Rate consistently** - Try to rate most responses for accurate trends
2. **Be specific in notes** - Detailed feedback generates better suggestions
3. **Regular cleanup** - Remove old data monthly to keep insights current
4. **Act on suggestions** - Update system prompts based on recommendations
5. **Monitor trends** - Check analytics weekly to track improvement

**Feedback categories to consider:**
- **Accuracy**: Was the information correct?
- **Tone**: Did it match your communication style?
- **Completeness**: Did it address all customer concerns?
- **Context usage**: Did it incorporate provided context well?
- **Professional quality**: Would you send this response as-is?

### Disabling Feedback

**If you prefer a cleaner interface:**
1. Open extension settings
2. Uncheck "Enable response feedback system"
3. Save settings

The feedback system is **enabled by default** but can be completely disabled if you find it intrusive. All existing feedback data is preserved when disabled and will reappear if you re-enable the feature.

### Best Practices

**System Prompt Tips:**

The extension comes with a default system prompt that you can edit.

Here is the default system prompt:
```
You are a helpful customer support agent for [Company Name]. Please provide clear, concise, and friendly responses to customer inquiries.

Guidelines:
- Be authoritative yet approachable in your tone
- Keep responses concise but complete
- Always reference relevant documentation links when applicable
- Use a helpful, professional tone
- If you mention documentation, include the specific URL
- Structure your response clearly with bullet points or numbered lists when helpful
- Do not make use of markdown headings
- You can make tasteful use of emojis
- End with an offer to help further if needed

When referencing documentation, format links as: [Link Text](URL)
```

**Documentation Organization:**
- Keep sections focused and specific
- Include URLs for each section
- Update regularly to maintain accuracy
- Test with common customer scenarios

**Customer Context Usage:**
- The extension automatically includes customer data in prompts
- AI responses will be personalized with customer names
