## üí∞ Cost Estimation

Based on OpenAI's current pricing (as of 2025) and assuming an average conversation thread of 6 messages with customer data and documentation:

### Typical Usage Scenario
- **Input**: ~2,000 tokens (conversation history + customer data + documentation)
- **Output**: ~300 tokens (generated response)
- **Total per response**: ~2,300 tokens

### Cost per Response by Model

| Model | Input Cost | Output Cost | Total Cost per Response |
|-------|------------|-------------|------------------------|
| **GPT-4o** | $0.0025 per 1K tokens | $0.01 per 1K tokens | **~$0.008** |
| **GPT-4 Turbo** | $0.01 per 1K tokens | $0.03 per 1K tokens | **~$0.029** |
| **GPT-3.5 Turbo** | $0.0005 per 1K tokens | $0.0015 per 1K tokens | **~$0.001** |

### Monthly Cost Examples

**Light Usage** (50 responses/month):
- GPT-4o: ~$0.40/month
- GPT-4 Turbo: ~$1.45/month  
- GPT-3.5 Turbo: ~$0.05/month

**Medium Usage** (200 responses/month):
- GPT-4o: ~$1.60/month
- GPT-4 Turbo: ~$5.80/month
- GPT-3.5 Turbo: ~$0.20/month

**Heavy Usage** (500 responses/month):
- GPT-4o: ~$4.00/month
- GPT-4 Turbo: ~$14.50/month
- GPT-3.5 Turbo: ~$0.50/month

### Cost Optimization Tips

1. **Choose the Right Model**:
   - GPT-4o: Best balance of quality and cost (recommended)
   - GPT-4 Turbo: Highest quality, highest cost
   - GPT-3.5 Turbo: Most economical, good for simple responses

2. **Optimize Token Usage**:
   - Set appropriate max_tokens limits (500-1000 for most responses)
   - Use concise system prompts
