## üì¶ Installation

1. **Download the Extension**
   - Clone this repository or download as ZIP
   - Extract to a local folder

2. **Load in Chrome**
   - Open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`
   - Enable "Developer mode" (top right toggle)
   - Click "Load unpacked" and select the extension folder

3. **Get OpenAI API Key**
   - Visit [OpenAI API Keys](https://platform.openai.com/api-keys)
   - Create a new API key
   - Copy the key for configuration

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

### Basic Setup

1. **Click the extension icon** in your Chrome toolbar
2. **Configure required settings**:
   - **OpenAI API Key**: Your API key from OpenAI
   - **OpenAI Model**: Choose from GPT-5 (latest, fast), GPT-5 Mini, GPT-5 Nano, GPT-4o, GPT-4 Turbo, or GPT-3.5 Turbo
   - **System Prompt**: Customize the AI's behavior and tone
   - **Keyboard Shortcut**: Default is Ctrl+Shift+G (Cmd+Shift+G on Mac)

### Advanced Settings

- **Temperature**: Control response creativity
  - `0.1` = Very consistent, predictable responses
  - `0.7` = Balanced (default)
  - `0.9` = More creative, varied responses
  - Note: For GPT‚Äë5 via the Responses API, this setting is ignored.

- **Max Tokens**: Control response length (50-4000)
  - `500` = Short responses
  - `1000` = Medium responses (default)
  - `2000+` = Longer, detailed responses
  - Note: For GPT‚Äë5 via the Responses API, the extension ignores this setting to avoid capping combined reasoning+text tokens, which can suppress visible output. Legacy models still use it.

- **Enable Feedback System**: Toggle response quality tracking
  - `Checked` = Show thumbs up/down buttons after responses (default)
  - `Unchecked` = Disable feedback collection for cleaner interface

You can provide additional context to help the AI generate more accurate responses:

**Example workflow:**
- **Type in reply field**: "this was a bug and we fixed it for today's 3.43.3 update"
- **Press Ctrl+Shift+G**
- **AI generates**: "Hi John, thanks for reporting this issue. This was indeed a bug that we've addressed in today's 3.43.3 update. Please update to the latest version and the issue should be resolved. Let me know if you need any help with the update process. Best, Sarah"

**Common context examples:**
- "offer 20% discount for renewal"
- "this feature will be available in next month's release"
- "customer is on legacy plan, needs migration"
- "escalate to development team"

### Providing Feedback on AI Responses

After each AI response is generated, you'll see feedback buttons:

**Rate the response:**
- **üëç Good** - Response was helpful and accurate
- **üëé Needs Work** - Response needs improvement

**For negative feedback:**
- Provide specific notes about what could be improved
- Common feedback areas: tone, accuracy, length, context usage

**Feedback Analytics:**
- View success rates and improvement trends in extension settings
- Get personalized suggestions based on your feedback patterns
- Export detailed feedback reports for analysis

## üìä Response Feedback System

The extension includes an intelligent feedback system to help you track and improve AI response quality over time.

### How It Works

**After each AI response generation:**
1. **Feedback buttons appear** below the reply editor (üëç Good / üëé Needs Work)
2. **Rate the response** with a single click
3. **Add improvement notes** (optional) for negative feedback
4. **Data is stored locally** in your browser for privacy

### Feedback Analytics Dashboard

**Available in extension settings:**
- **Success Rate**: Percentage of positive vs negative responses (last 30 days)
- **Response Volume**: Total number of rated responses
- **Smart Suggestions**: AI-powered recommendations based on feedback patterns
- **Trend Analysis**: Track improvement over time

### Common Feedback Patterns

The system automatically identifies issues and provides suggestions:

| **Issue Detected** | **Suggested Improvement** |
|-------------------|-------------------------|
| Too formal/robotic | Add "Use a friendly, conversational tone" to system prompt |
| Too casual | Add "Maintain a professional tone" to system prompt |
| Missing context | Provide more specific context before generation |
| Too long/verbose | Reduce max tokens or add "Be concise" to system prompt |
| Too short/incomplete | Increase max tokens or add "Provide detailed explanations" |
| Wrong tone | Review tone instructions and previous message analysis |

- **Automatic cleanup** - Configurable retention periods
- **Export capability** - Take your data with you anytime

### Best Practices

**For optimal feedback insights:**

1. **Rate consistently** - Try to rate most responses for accurate trends
2. **Be specific in notes** - Detailed feedback generates better suggestions
3. **Regular cleanup** - Remove old data monthly to keep insights current
4. **Act on suggestions** - Update system prompts based on recommendations
5. **Monitor trends** - Check analytics weekly to track improvement

**Feedback categories to consider:**
- **Accuracy**: Was the information correct?
- **Tone**: Did it match your communication style?
- **Completeness**: Did it address all customer concerns?
- **Context usage**: Did it incorporate provided context well?
- **Professional quality**: Would you send this response as-is?

### Disabling Feedback

**If you prefer a cleaner interface:**
1. Open extension settings
2. Uncheck "Enable response feedback system"
3. Save settings

The feedback system is **enabled by default** but can be completely disabled if you find it intrusive. All existing feedback data is preserved when disabled and will reappear if you re-enable the feature.

### GPT‚Äë5 Integration Tuning

- File: `gpt5.js` contains all GPT‚Äë5 Responses API behavior behind a small helper (`window.GPT5`).
- Tweak these defaults to experiment without affecting legacy integrations:
  - `reasoningEffort`: `'minimal' | 'low' | 'medium' | 'high'` (default: `'high'`)
  - `textFormat`: `'text'` (ensures visible assistant message output)
  - `textVerbosity`: `'medium'`
  - `maxOutputTokens`: `null` (if set, caps reasoning + text together)
  - `toolChoice`, `parallelToolCalls`, `serviceTier`, `store`, `stream`, `include`
- The content script calls `GPT5.buildRequest(...)` and `GPT5.extractReply(...)`. You can also adjust at runtime via the DevTools console:
  - `GPT5.setConfig({ reasoningEffort: 'medium' })`
  - `GPT5.getConfig()`
Note: The legacy response feedback UI has been removed to simplify the experience.
